                        <p>I had my first contact with drones much later than with photography. Despite that, it was my passion long before. What interested me in drones was not the audiovisual aspect, but being able to fly and see the world from a bird's point of view.</p>
                        <p>My first flight was with a Parrot Rolling Spider, but my first real big drone was the Parrot Bebop 2, which I got for Christmas (I remember it like it was yesterday).</p>
                        <p>I had several small drones in addition to the Bebop 2, but it was with this one that I made my first flights in the mountains and over water.</p>
                        <p>My first salary was used to buy a DJI Air 3 (Parrot stopped making video drones so I had no choice, but I remain a shareholder with them).</p>
